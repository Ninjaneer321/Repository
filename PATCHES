I've retrieved the content of the repository. Now, I will create the `.github/workflows/patch.yml` file with the provided content.

```yaml
name: Patch Repository

on: [push]

jobs:
  patch:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Apply patch
      run: |
        # Apply patch commands here
        echo "Applying patch..."
        # For example, you could use a patch file
        # patch -p1 < patches/your-patch-file.patch

    - name: Commit changes
      run: |
        git config --global user.name 'github-actions[bot]'
        git config --global user.email 'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com'
        git add .
        git commit -m "Applied patch"
        git push
```

You can follow these steps to create the file:
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Go to the `.github/workflows/` directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.
3. Click "Add file" and select "Create new file".
4. Name the file `patch.yml`.
5. Paste the above YAML content into the file.
6. Commit the new file to the repository.
